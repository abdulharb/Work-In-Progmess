# Work-In-Progmess

Hello! My name is AbdulAlrhman Harb, but you can call me Abdul. I'm a Cyber Security professional with a passion for expanding my HomeLab and diving into side projects. Inspired by Ted Lasso, "Work In Progmess" is where I'll be sharing my journey—warts and all! The goal is to make it easier for others to follow along without too much hassle.

### What Inspired This Blog?

I wanted to document things that not many people are covering or that are typically done only in an enterprise setting. By sharing my experiences, I hope to bridge that gap and make this knowledge more accessible.

### What Will I Be Doing?

I'll be exploring a lot of exciting things. One major project on my radar is recreating [DetectionLab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab/). But first, I have a lot to learn! Other topics I'll cover include home networking with my Alta Lab AP/Switch, networking with Cisco switches, some Red Team activities, and a strong focus on detection engineering.

### My Setup

I'm using Proxmox on my gaming desktop and an old MacBook Pro that I had lying around. I've also been using Obsidian.md, which has quickly become one of my favorite tools for organizing my notes and ideas.

### Who Is This For?

I'm aiming to reach people in Cyber Security or those looking to get into the field. Sysadmins might also find this blog useful. Another big interest of mine is automation, so there will be plenty of that too!

### What Can You Expect?

I'll do my best to make everything clear, but if something isn't, please open an issue and let me know. I'll do my best to fix it. I might even venture into making some YouTube videos — let's see how this goes!

Feel free to reach out if there's anything you'd like me to dive deep into or explore. I'm open to suggestions and eager to learn alongside you!

This is going to be fun :)
